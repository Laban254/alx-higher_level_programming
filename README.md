# Higher-level programming - Python, Databases & JavaScript
## Zen (Python) 
<details>
<summary>The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters</summary>
<br>
Beautiful is better than ugly.<br>
Explicit is better than implicit.<br>
Simple is better than complex.<br>
Complex is better than complicated.<br>
Flat is better than nested.<br>
Sparse is better than dense.<br>
Readability counts.<br>
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.<br>
Although practicality beats purity.<br>
Errors should never pass silently.<br>
Unless explicitly silenced.<br>
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br>
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<br>
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.<br>
Now is better than never.<br>
Although never is often better than *right* now.<br>
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br>
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br>
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

<summary> Install Python3, pip3 and pycodestyle</summary>

- Pycodestyle is now the new standard of Python style code.

<pre>$ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip<br>$ pip install pycodestyle</pre>

- Confirm you have the right version.

<pre>$ pycodestyle --version<br>$</pre>

# About


This repository contains programs written for the higher-level programming
track at Holberton School. In these projects, which began occurring in month
four of the year one curriculum, I learned Python, MySQL and JavaScript.
Simultaneously, I continued to reinforce and expand my skills in C and shell
scripting. The specific list of projects contained follows:

* [0x00. Python - Hello, World](./0x00-python-hello_world)
* [0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions](./0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions)
* [0x02. Python - import & modules](./0x02-python-import_modules)
* [0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples](./0x03-python-data_structures)
* [0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary](./0x04-python-more_data_structures)
* [0x05. Python - Exceptions](./0x05-python-exceptions)
* [0x06. Python - Classes and Objects](./0x06-python-classes)
* [0x07. Python - Test-driven development](./0x07-python-test_driven_development)
* [0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects](./0x08-python-more_classes)
* [0x09. Python - Everything is object](./0x09-python-everything_is_object)
* [0x0A. Python - Inheritance](./0x0A-python-inheritance)
* [0x0B. Python - Input/Output](./0x0B-python-input_output)
* [0x0C. Python - Almost a circle](./0x0C-python-almost_a_circle)
* [0x0D. SQL - Introduction](./0x0D-SQL_introduction)
* [0x0E. SQL - More queries](./0x0E-SQL_more_queries)
* [0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping](./0x0F-python-object_relational_mapping)
* [0x12. Javascript - Warm up](./0x12-javascript-warm_up)
* [0x13. Javascript - Objects, Scopes and Closures](./0x13-javascript_objects_scopes_closures)
